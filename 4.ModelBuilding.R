#************************************************************#
#*  Build Logistic Growth Model using Existing Data
#************************************************************#

#* Model Formula:
#* Y = (ùùã1) / (1 + exp{-((t-ùùã2)/ùùã3)})
#* 
#* Model Parameters:
#* Y: The number of cases at day "t"
#* t: Day number (i.e. 5 = 5th day)
#* ùùã1 (Phi1): Upper limit for Y (maximum value)
#* 1/ùùã3 (Phi3): Non-negative value representing Daily Growth Rate
#* 
#* Model Selection (Logistic Growth rather than Exponential Growth Model):
#* 1. It's ability to limit the increase to a value (i.e. cases) rather than increasing to infinite [more realistic]
